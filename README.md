Submit your code. 1. Retrieve all approved drugs from the ChEMBL database, sort them by approval year and name (a Python example is here; documentations of the ChEMBL API can be found here); 2. For each approved drug since 2012 that you identified in step (1), retrieve a list of UniProt accession numbers, namely protein targets associated with the drug; 3. For each protein with a UniProt accession number that you identified in step (2), retrieve UniProt keywords associated with it. You can use the UniProt API, documented here. Python and R clients are also available.
